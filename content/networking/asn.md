## General
Autonomous System
- Group of IP networks, run by one or more network operators, Adminstrative entitty (ISPs, Enterprise, Mobile Networks, Telecomm Network Operators..)
- So essentially, a Self operating network (of a large scale or ?) with self managed routing policy

ASN:
A Number for identification for the ASes, assigned by internet registries
Here are some regional internet registries
- ARIN: American Registry of internet numbers, North America
- APNIC: Asia Pacific
- AFRNIC: Africa
- RIPE: Regional Internet Registry for Europe, Middle East and Central Asia
- LACNIC: Latin America and Caribbean

So internet is routing between ASes?
