There are two main IPv4 address spaces—the public address space and the private address space

Diff: Public address space is routable via the internet

**The public address space is divided into five classes:**
Class A	0.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255
Class B	128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
Class C	192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
Class D	224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
Class E	240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255

**Class D** addresses are used for multicast traffic. These addresses are not assignable. **Class E** addresses are reserved for experimental usage and are not assignable.

classes A, B, and C are commonly used on devices that are directly connected to the internet, such as layer 3 switches, routers, firewalls, servers, and any other network-related device.

**The private address space is divided into three classes:**
Class A—10.0.0.0/8 network block	10.0.0.0 - 010.255.255.255
Class B—172.16.0.0/12 network block	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
Class C—192.168.0.0/16 network block	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
