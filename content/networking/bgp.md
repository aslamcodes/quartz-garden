# Border Gateway Protocol or BGP

v1. Set of rules that help routers of the internet to route data 
v2. BGP directs how traffic is routed between the thousands of autonomous systems

- A Protocol that's evolved to faciliate exchange between autonomous networks, without centralised control.
- You wouldn't really allow traffic to pass through your network, if there's no one paying for that;
- Either the source or the destination, So Shortest path wouldn' really work in the internet.
- BGP is kinda restrictive in this manner, Interesting.

- So, Politics, Economics, Polices are all, factors that can be represented to BGP, in some form, which i don't know of yet, which
- BGP takes into the representaions into account, when it needs to direct the traffic between systems.
