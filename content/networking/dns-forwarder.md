> A DNS server contacts another nameserver when it can't resolve

When you have an internal DNS server with your local company records and want to offload internet dns requests to the ISP's dns server, you can setup DNS forwarding.

Without DNS forwarding - Your server will perform the recursive resolving for all queries
With DNS forwarding - You forward dns queries to central DNS server, reducing the load on our server
