**Amazon Security Finding Format**

**Workflow** status - ASFF can be marked as **New**, **Suppressed**, **Resolved**, **Notified** for management purposes.

Security Hub CSPM normalizes findings from all sources into a standard syntax and format called theÂ _AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF)_.

ASFF is a json format

ASFF are automatically updated if underlying issue is resolved
Findings are archived automatically if the resource is deleted or no longer applicable.

> [!WARNING] Findings past 90 days are deleted
