![[Screenshot 2025-07-06 at 14.57.33.png]]You have three kind of policies
- Cache - Controls caching behavior 
- Origin Request - Controls the forwarding behavior
- Response Headers - Controls the response behavior

Polices in general will be used to control behavior

Values in cache policy will automatically involved in the cache key, which will not be included in orgin request, so you would not want to include here again
