You must enable dns support and dns hostnames for ec2 instances withing private hosted names

# Question
If Not dns support -> The instances won't talk with the Route53 resolver. The Route53 resolver. The private hosted zones are created under a VPC.
If Not DNS hostnames -> I would just not receive public DNS names for public instance. But Why its required for private zone is still unknown for me

Can't ping private dns name, but private ip
