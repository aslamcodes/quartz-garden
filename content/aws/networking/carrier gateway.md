A carrier gateway serves two purposes. It allows inbound traffic from a carrier network in a specific location, and it allows outbound traffic to the carrier network and the internet. There is no inbound connection configuration from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway. Carrier gateways are only available for VPCs that contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone.
