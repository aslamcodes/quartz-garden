We can create a endpoint service of type network or gateway, which exposes a service name. on some other vpc an endpoint can be created, which is going to be an ENI, when given the service name, it connects them using aws privatelink.

On prem networks can be connected via direct connect or s2s to the endpoint service![[Udemy ScreenShot 2025-06-29 12-08-26.jpeg]]
