- [ states can be encrypted if you configure your backend, if s3 such as](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/s3)
	- Uses backed enabled encryption of s3
- The implicit dependency in on the `web_server` as it uses the eip.
```HCP
resource "aws_eip" "public_ip" {
    vpc      = true
    instance = aws_instance.web_server.id
}
 
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on    = [aws_s3_bucket.company_data]
}
```
- The resource type is identified by "resource" word ðŸ™„
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "db" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
- `terraform import` only import resources into the state file, not generate any configuration, you'd need to use `import` block **instead** to generate the accompanying configuration 
	- `import block` vs `import command`
		- Declarative vs imperative

- `list[0]` is same as `element(list, 0)
- terraform recommends 2 spaces on each nested levels
- terraform is an immutable language
	- mutable in the sense the how we use configuration management tools, that updates in place, but sometimes some components fail due to arbitrary reasons resulting in a half ass state
	- https://youtu.be/II4PFe9BbmE
	- But terraform is immutable, Which needs creation of new version totally.

- terraform recommends 2 spaces on each nested levels
- `splat` expression
```
[for o in var.list : o.id] 
var.list[*].id # splat
```
